# bees-portfolio

Hi! I'm Bee and this is my portfolio: 
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a background mostly outside of the tech industry. I'm currently working on my portfolio and learning new technologies. I'm looking for a position where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer. My only real experience before this was with some Doom modding when I was younger and some fairly limited UDK3/4 work. I've always got a few projects in the works so make sure to check back often to see what I've been working on, or check out my Github! I'm also open to any suggestions or feedback you might have, so feel free to reach out! As a thank you for reading this far i'll let you know a secret about the site, try clicking my name up on the navbar!
